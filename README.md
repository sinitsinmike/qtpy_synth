# qtpy_synth

A simple [QTPy RP2040](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qt-py-2040/overview)-based
synth to experiment with [`synthio`](https://github.com/todbot/circuitpython-synthio-tricks).

Some programs written specifically for this board:

- [simpletouchsynth](https://github.com/todbot/qtpy_synth/tree/main/circuitpython/simpletouchsynth) - play with filters using touch sensors

- [wavesynth](https://github.com/todbot/qtpy_synth/tree/main/circuitpython/wavesynth) - larger general two-osc synth that can also do wavetables
  - early video demo: ["Wavetable synth w/ CircuitPython synthio on QTPy RP2040"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hgDi6MNfsI)
  - another demo: [More Wavetable synth w/ CircuitPython synthio on QTPy RP2040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80yjwxscnnA)

For [many other synthio examples](https://github.com/todbot/circuitpython-synthio-tricks/tree/main/examples)
that can work with this synth with minimal changes,
